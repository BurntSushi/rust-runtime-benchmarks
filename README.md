These are a collection of benchmarks for measuring and tracking the
performance of code generated by `rustc`. They consist of code found
in the wild. These benchmarks are a work in progress and should not be
considered as anything but an internal way to track rustc's
performance. Perhaps they may eventually evolve into a more standard
"benchmark suite", but they are not there yet. =)
