These are a collection of benchmarks for measuring and tracking the
performance of code generated by `rustc`. They consist of code found
in the wild. These benchmarks are a work in progress and should not be
considered as anything but an internal way to track rustc's
performance. Perhaps they may eventually evolve into a more standard
"benchmark suite", but they are not there yet. =)

Right now, using the "suite" is very manual: change into each
directory and run `cargo bench`. One of the top priority items is to
create a runner that will do that for you, record the results (along
with compilation time, ideally) and allow you to compare those
results. If you're interested, see [issue #2]. :)
